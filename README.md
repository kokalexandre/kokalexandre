## Hi there 👋

I'm Alexandre KOK, a second-year engineering student at Télécom SudParis, focusing on Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

### Current focus
I’m currently working on probabilistic diffusion models.

### Selected projects
- [hi-paris-2025](https://github.com/kokalexandre/hi-paris-2025) — 🏆 _2nd / 80+ teams, Hi!ckathon 2025_: ML pipeline for the PISA dataset (training/inference on SLURM).
- **NExUS** — 🏆 _1st / 30+ teams, NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025_: Exoplanet explorer + new observation submission + real-time transit probability estimates.

If you don’t see a project on my GitHub yet, it will be available soon.
